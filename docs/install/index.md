# Installation guide

Sampling of metabolic models is a two-step process. The first step is the generation of warmup points that will be used as a startign point
for the actual sampling.

## Generation of warmup points

To generate warmup points for metabolic models, we will use the `VFWarmup` tool that uses a hybrid MPI/OpenMP distributed approach to ensure dynamic load balancing.

### Requirements
Linux-based system

IBM CPlex 12.6.3 Free academic version http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/fr/ibmilogcpleoptistud

OpenMp comes by default in the latest gcc versions

MPI through the OpenMPI 1.10.3

## Sampling

The actual sampling uses `ACHR.cu` and starts from the warmup points generated by `VFWarmup`. It is a CUDA-based GP-GPU software.

### Requirements
Linux-based system

Nvidia GPU with sm_35 architecture. Check the specs of your card here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA

This architecture is needed as `ACHR.cu` uses nested parallelism to gain even higher speed-ups.
